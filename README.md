Good Permiso team, everyone — and thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. I really appreciate you making space for this conversation, and I’m looking forward to learning more about your goals and seeing whether there’s a practical way we can support what you’re trying to achieve.


To quickly set the context, my name is Krileva, and I’m Sales Representative at Boss Company. I’m joined by the best, who leads cyber security, and together we work with organizations that are looking to  reduce risk, improve visibility, and modernize the way they manage digital exposure. The reason I’m excited about today’s meeting is that, from what we’ve seen so far, it sounds like you’re tackling a set of priorities that many of our best partners have faced — balancing speed and innovation with operational clarity, security, and measurable outcomes.

Also, just to be clear about intent: this isn’t a hard-sell call. We’re not here to push a one-size-fits-all product. We’re here to see if there’s a strong enough match between your needs and what we do exceptionally well. If there is, great — we’ll map out a clear plan. If not, I’m still happy to share insights and point you toward best practices or alternative options that might be more appropriate.
